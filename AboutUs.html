        <p> A restaurant is a place designed to provide dining spaces and social environments for people to enjoy.  Students at Tufts are seeking sit-down restaurant
            experience that they currently can't get on campus.  A restaurant where Italian food is served and memories are made, Jumbo Italia brings a taste of Italy to Cummings Center.
