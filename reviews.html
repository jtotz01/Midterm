			<div class="description">Easily my favorite dining option on campus!  I went last Saturday for the grand opening and everything from the food to the ambiance was stunning!  I ordered the Mushroom Carbonara with a side of linguini.  The Carbonara was perfectly cooked with just a bit of char on the top... delicious.  The linguini was a bit al dente, but the pasta sauce was to die for!  When I was there, the tufts Italian band was playing, and their music added to the experience.  I highly recommend everyone check out this brand new spot for campus food.</div>

			<div class="description">The best thing to being added to Tufts Campus in the last 20 years!!  I was excited about the new Cummings Center, but when I found out it would be the home of a brand new Italian Restaurant I couldn't believe my eyes.  I was first in line on opening day and I was extremely impressed with every aspect of this fantastic new dining location.  I ordered the Risotto Alla Milanese with a side of spinach and was blown away by the quality of this meal.  After eating at Dewick for the past month this was a breath of fresh air.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and after my meal, I was the first to hit the dance floor to jam out to the Tufts Italian Band.  Everyone needs to check this place out ASAP!</div>

			<div class="description">While the food is more above average for the tufts dining services, I could not justify giving this restaurant more than two stars due to the underwhelming atmosphere and limited menu.  Before I even ordered, the band was playing so loud I could barely hear the person next to me!  When I finally was able to get a table, the menu was tiny.  I understand this is a new dining option, however, they must expand their selection of dishes, or else I don't think this location will last long.  That said, I ordered the Pasta Con Pomodoro E Basilico with apple juice, and both were exquisite.  I will be giving Jumbo Italiano another chance very soon.
